I knew it!!!!!! Pat isn't a snake plant! I found an app that identifies plants from a picture, and turns out I was actually sent a corn plant (Dracaena fragrans). They are tree-like and can grow up to 6' tall! Oye!!! But it's a flowering plant, so yay!

Misty's lily white leaves started turning green ðŸ˜­ Looked up why and turns out more sunshine affects photosynthesis which makes it greener. So much conflicting info out there...I read the exact opposite that more sunshine makes it whiter!!! So I moved it from my office and into the dining room.

Today my soil arrived, so I planted the basil, dill and chives seeds. Pretty basic stuff, they all went into self watering pots which I covered with saran wrap.
