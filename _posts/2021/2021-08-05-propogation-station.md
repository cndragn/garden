I've decided to try my hand at propogating some of my plants!  I was looking up how to make my plants look more full, and found advice to propogate and then replant the new sections with the plant.  Sprite, my prayer plant, just looks....wierd. The main part of the plant is flat looking, and it had one awkward looking section growing off of it, so I cut that part off.  I also trimmed off some of the longer parts of Luci and Charmeuse, two of my pothos, since they are growing long vines but the plant itself is quite thin.

So, from my research the way I went about it is, I made sure each section of my pothos had at least 2 nodes, and a limit of 2 leaves. I read this is to make sure more energy goes towards growing roots rather than maintaining a lot of leaves, but then also, need at least two leaves for photosynthesis.  I couldnt do that with my prayer plant since the leaves were all so condensed coming from one node, plus new leaves are growing and my heart could not handle the idea of killing off little baby leaves!

On the bottom node, I applied a root hormone called Clonex, then put them in water. It can take a couple weeks to a month before they are ready to plant.  From what I read, I should plant them once the roots are around an inch or so long.  It's not good to leave them in water any longer than necessary, because it will make it harder on the plant to acclimate to growing in soil instead of water.

 I found these super cute mini milk bottles to use for propogation. I got quite a few of them, and hope to propogate more plants so I can do some trades. But for now, will see how this comes along...  hope it works!!!
