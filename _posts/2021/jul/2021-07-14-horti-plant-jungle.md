It was a long, dark, cold, rough winter for my plants.  Seeing them suffer killed my motivation, but we're all coming back around.  Unfortunately, Pat did not survive, which is a bummer because I really liked them.  All my herbs decided they refuse to put up with insufferable conditions and died at the same time. It's hard to tell if Duppy is dead or alive so its kind of touch and go.

The rest of my plants just survived ...except Luci. He wasn't about to let me get in the way of his personal growth...and holy cow he's huge now!

I was on a mission to tend to my plants and take really good care of them. Then I decided I should start my herb garden again.  Then I decided it would be nice to buy a plant stand, and got one that I loooove! My sister got plant lights for me to help with my herbs, and I went ahead and got some lights for the stand too.  All set and I had no want for anything, I had everything I needed!

So, what happened was...(yes, this will be a long convoluted rediculous story to absolve myself of all blame) Kiddo has a sticker subscription and had just gotten her first shipment of a stationary subscription.  I was so jelly to see her getting these cool things in the mail, so I went to see if I could find a subscription I like. Then I remembered Horti has a plant subscrition. I was just about to order a modest one plant a month subscription when Lincoln distracted me (yes, Im blaming the dog too) and I must've hit a wrong key cause all of a sudden I had an order for a plant jungle.  Can you believe it?!!  

So, now I have five new plants, and they are all beautiful!  I got Ducky a Rubber Plant, Malachi a Jade Plant, Naga a Snake Plant, Victoria a Queen Marble Pothos, and Zoltan an Earth Star.
