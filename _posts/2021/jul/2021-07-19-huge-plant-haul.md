A friend of mine introduced me to a guy who also started getting interested in plants during the pandemic. Like me, one plant quickly turned into all the plants, but he kept going, and going until he had nearly 90 of them!!  He decided it was time to let some of them go so of course I had to adopt a few of those lovelies!!  

I think I showed a decent amount of restraint, and only chose 10 of them to add to my plant family.  I'm very excited over Bubbles the Monstera.  I think Monsteras are so beautiful, but they get so huge...this one is much smaller and trailing which is pretty cool! I also got Cain the Camoflauge Dieffenbachia and Sprite the Lemon Lime Prayer Plant.  I picked up five Calatheas: Vittus a Vittata, Veronica a Picturata Silver, Laurel a Medallion, and Sirius and Stilletto. They are both the same plant, but go by several different common names, so just based which name I used on how they look: Sirius goes by Beauty Star and Stilletto, which is now the largest plant I own and my only floor plant, is the Pinstripe.  I also added two more Pothos, Serima the N'Joy and Charmeuse the Satin.  Apparently Satin Pothos isnt really a pothos...but it sure looks like one so it's commonly sold as one.

They are all so incrediby beautiful! Very excited to have new plants to take care of and watch grow. I'm also super excited to have so many traliing plants now.  I love the way Luci looks as he grows long and drapes over the cabinet in the bathroom, so Im looking forward to putting trailing plants on my mantle and the shelf in my office. They will look so amazing!

They have thrips, a plant pest, so I treated them with a spray I made using 1tsp neem oil, 1 tsp dish soap and 5 drops of tea tree oil.  Have to emulsify the oil with soap because water and oil dont mix, then shake it up with a bit of warm water, and then add that to a liter of water, and mist the crap out of the leaves. I placed sticky traps in all their pots, and have them all quarantined.  Fingers crossed that takes care of the thrips and they can join the rest of the plant family soon.  Super nice side note, I've been having ant problems, so I made a stronger solution to clean surfaces with and it looks like the ants want absolutely nothing to do with being around it. YAY!

I lost Pat which is a huge bummer, but it's been a year and all my other houseplants are doing great! Well, except Duppy, he has me so confused. I'm blown away by how well they are doing because I usually really suck at keeping plants alive.  I'm starting to feel confident about this whole thing and really love having them around making my home look nice =)
