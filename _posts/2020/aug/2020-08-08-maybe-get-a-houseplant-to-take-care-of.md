That's where all this started. About 2 weeks ago, it was suggested to me to get a plant as a pleasurable low key activity that would give me something to work on, and help me feel accomplished as I see it grow. I've killed every plant I've ever had, so I didnt think it was that great of an idea, but I decided to give it a shot.

I got an overwhemling amount of suggestions for what plant to get, and then I decided...get all the plants! I did a ton of research and a ton of shopping. On the bright side, it gives me more chances to end up with a survivor, and it's a really nice decorative touch to my home.

First thing I ordered is a set of aloe. I named the twins Gemini. Then I found a set of plants that are supposed to be good for beginners and I decided Id need pots for those, and potting soil of course. What arrived were the devils ivy(pothos) that I named Luci, a peace lily (sansevieria) I named Misty because it needs to be misted often, and a snake plant (sapathiphyllum) named Pat. Im not sure it really is a snake plant, but dont know what it could be.

Thennnn...while waiting for those to arrive, I thought I'd give growing herbs another try, so I ordered some seeds and self watering plants for them. They're all named Herbert...Herb for short. Except the mint...that one doesn't like nicknames. So far, I've planted the thyme, mint and organo. The parsley and cilantro seeds are soaking, and I'll plant those today and tomorrow.

Today I bought a soil moisture meter so that I can stay on top of the plants that arent in self watering pots. I have a spare 6" ceramic pot, so I'll get another plant, maybe a legit snake plant. I also think it would be nice to have a plant in the bathroom, so I'll need to research what plants like humidity. And...and..and...

Well, okay, I need to slow my roll and manage the plants I already have before I get more stuff...maybe.
