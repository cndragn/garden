The Herbert's are coming in fast and strong! Basil actually made it's debut yesterday, and then today Dill came out to say hello. Parsley is a bit shy...only one teeny bit of green peeping through the soil, so I've decided to leave the saran wrap on for another day while it continues to sprout.

So now, over half of my herbs have sprouted!!! Just waiting for Cilantro, Mint, and Chives to come around.
