The Herbert's are coming in fast and strong! Basil actually made it's debut yesterday, and then today Dill came out to say hello. Parsley is a bit shy...only one teeny bit of green peeping through the soil, so I've decided to leave the saran wrap on for another day while it continues to sprout.

So now, over half of my herbs have sprouted!!! Just waiting for Cilantro, Mint, and Chives to come around.

Edit: I swear when I started updating my blog a couple hours ago, there was no sign of Chives. Just did my rounds because it's what I do all day everyday, and noticed the Chives have arrived! Man, that was fast...! I've moved them out of the dark closet they were in for germination, and let them join the rest of the Herbert's in the kitchen window.

Edit 2: Did some research to find out whats going on with my herbs that havent sprouted yet. Found out that mint needs light to germinate so I sprinkled some seeds on top. Hopefully I'll see some progress with Herbert Mint over the next few days. No idea whats going on with Cilantro though.
