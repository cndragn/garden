I aquired (stole? rescued?) another plant! A year ago, Ski bought a bunch of succulents for her room and then forgot about them. She didn't even bring them with her when she's moved downstairs. I thought they all died, but today I noticed one was still hanging on!

It's a Ghost Plant (graptopetalum paraguayense), and I've decided to name it Duppy! Its a trailing plant so it will be really interesting to see how this one grows and develops.

Edit: The pics are 2 days apart; The first photo is of when I first adopted Duppy on Aug 15, and the other from Aug 17 all plumped up and looking so pretty! What a difference a couple days of care makes!
