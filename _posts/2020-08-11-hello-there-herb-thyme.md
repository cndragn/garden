[!Thyme sprouts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cndragn/garden/master/assets/images/thyme-aug11.png)

I'm so excited! I planted Herb Thyme on Aug 7, and only 3 days later it already sprouted! I'm really surprised because I wasn't expecting that to happen for 21-28 days. I checked it this morning and about jumped out my skin to see the little specks of green. Just checked it again this evening, and I swear more has sprouted and its gotten bigger.

Can hardly wait to see how it comes along, and also to see what will sprout next :)
