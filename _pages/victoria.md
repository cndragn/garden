**Jul 14, 2021: Welcome home Victoria!** Victoria is part of the Hard To Kill Jungle Set from Horti. Victorias namesake is Queen Victora whose marble statue is at Kensington Palace. Seemed like the proper thing to do.  I'm very excited to add another pothos to the family, and such a beautiful one! I really love the marbling, it's so beautiful!
