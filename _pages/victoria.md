#### Devil's Ivy | Marble Queen Pothos

Pothos is super easy going and can do well in bright or low light, and fine with dry soil or even vases of water. Can survive and grow in just about any environment and can get out of control, giving it the name the Devil's Ivy.

**Jul 14, 2021: Welcome home Victoria!** Victoria is part of the Hard To Kill Jungle Set from Horti. Victorias namesake is Queen Victora whose marble statue is at Kensington Palace. Seemed like the proper thing to do.  I'm very excited to add another pothos to the family, and such a beautiful one! I really love the marbling, it's so beautiful!
