#### Corn Plant | Dracaena fragrans

##### Description and Care

The corn plant requires little care. The soil should be kept moist, but not soggy. Though it can handle low light, it does best in bright but indirect light. Avoid direct sun as it will burn the leaves. A few yellow leaves is normal, but too many may be a sign of overwatering.

##### Updates

**Aug 14: Pat has been properly identified!** Using an app called PictureThis, I was able to find out what exactly Pat is! They feel so much more connected to it's roots now that it has a better understanding of itself, I'm quite sure of it. I've updated the plant name and description to reflect this new phase in Pat's life.

**Aug 7: Welcome home Pat!** I got this one in a variety set from Costa Farms. It's supposed to be a snake plant, but I keep doing research and can't find any that look like this one does. It's really pretty though, I like how its kind of tree-like in how the leaves only grow from the top and not like a bush. I had it in my office because I thought it can handle sunlight, but realizing now that I got mixed up, so I'm going to exchange it with Misty since the livingroom doesnt get direct sun.
