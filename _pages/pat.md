**Aug 7: Welcome home Pat!** I got this one in a variety set from Costa Farms. It's supposed to be a snake plant, but I keep doing research and can't find any that look like this one does. It's really pretty though, I like how its kind of tree-like in how the leaves only grow from the top and not like a bush. I had it in my office because I thought it can handle sunlight, but realizing now that I got mixed up, so I'm going to exchange it with Misty since the livingroom doesnt get direct sun.
