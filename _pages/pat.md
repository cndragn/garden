#### Corn Plant | Dracaena fragrans

The corn plant requires little care. The soil should be kept moist, but not soggy. Though it can handle low light, it does best in bright but indirect light. Avoid direct sun as it will burn the leaves. A few yellow leaves is normal, but too many may be a sign of overwatering.

##### Updates

**Winter 2000: RIP Pat** I messed up...big time and Pat ended up paying the ultimate price.  It was a long dark winter. My plants were suffering and so when the sun started coming out, I decided to put some of them outside so they can finally get some sunshine...and then I left home for the weekend. I checked on them before I left, and Misty wasn't having it...only a couple hours outside and her leaves were completely wilted, so I brought her in and left the rest.  The temperature dropped, and it rained the entire weekend.  I brought everyone in when I came back home, but the damage was done. Pat was dead within the week.  A poinsetta I got for Christmas joined him in the great beyond. The Gemini Twins had a rough go of things, but after awhile they forgave me and came back around. 

Pat will be dearly remembered for their patience whlie we figured out together who they were. They sat tall and beautiful on the mantle, enjoying movie nights and terrible pandemic reality shows with me.  Big up Pat, you will always be remembered with love. *Drizzles fertilized water to the ground, kisses fingers to the sky*

**Aug 14, 2021: Pat has been properly identified!** Using an app called PictureThis, I was able to find out what exactly Pat is! They feel so much more connected to it's roots now that it has a better understanding of itself, I'm quite sure of it. I've updated the plant name and description to reflect this new phase in Pat's life.

**Aug 7, 2021: Welcome home Pat!** I got this one in a variety set from Costa Farms. It's supposed to be a snake plant, but I keep doing research and can't find any that look like this one does. It's really pretty though, I like how its kind of tree-like in how the leaves only grow from the top and not like a bush. I had it in my office because I thought it can handle sunlight, but realizing now that I got mixed up, so I'm going to exchange it with Misty since the livingroom doesnt get direct sun.
