**Jul 14, 2021: Welcome home Zoltan!** Zoltan is part of the Hard To Kill Jungle Set from Horti. Okay, I'll be honest...when I first lay eyes on them my heart kind of sank.  I definitely would not have chosen it on my own, it just looked like blaaaah in a pot. But I repotted it and set it up, cause its mine and part of the family now. When I checked it out the next day my whole perception changed, it's such a quirky looing plant with really cool stripes and now I'm so glad I have them!
