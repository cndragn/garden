#### Dumb Cane Camouflage | Dieffenbachia Seguine

Dieffenbachia Camouflage is an eye-catching plant with uniquely patterned foliage on large, lush leaves. The name "dumb cane" comes from its ability to cause mouth paralysis and speechlessness in those who bite the plant.

**Jul 19, 2021: Welcome home Cain!** Cain comes to me as part of a big haul of ten plants from a friend whittling down his plant family. I've never seen anything like this plant, I love the cammo vibe, and super excited because he should grow into a beautiful large sized plant. Lincoln is a curious sniffer, not a biter, but I'll still play it safe and keep this one out of reach of my pup.
