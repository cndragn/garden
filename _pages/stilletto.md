#### Calethea Pinstripe | Goeppertia Ornata

Like other plants in the marantaceae family, this Calathea has the interesting habit of rising leaves in the morning and lowering them at night, like in prayer, giving it the nickname "prayer plant." This is the very same plant as the Beauty Star, Pinstripe is simply another name it's known by.

**Jul 19, 2021: Welcome home Stilletto!** Stilletto comes to me as part of a big haul of ten plants from a friend whittling down his plant family.  I mistook this plant and the Sirius, the Beauty Star for two different types of plants, but they are the same one!  Stilletto is my biggest plant and only floor plant, so shes kind of the big bad boss of my plant family.  Seemed fitting to give her an edgy mafia name, I feel like that would be her style.  There's way less leaves than her little brother Sirius, so hopefully as she gets healthy, more leaves will grow in.
