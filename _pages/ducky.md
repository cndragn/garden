**Jul 14, 2021: Welcome home Ducky!** Ducky is part of the Hard To Kill Jungle Set from Horti. I've never seen a houseplant like this before, even though it seems like a common one. Oh well, it's new to me! His full name is Rubber Ducky, but I just call him Ducky.  Definitely will put him to work to help me code.
