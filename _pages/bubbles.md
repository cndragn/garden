#### Swiss Cheese Vine | Monstera Adansonii

Monsteras are often called Swiss cheese plants or vines for their leaves lacy holes and notches, and adansonii is arguably the cheesiest of them all. Also known as "Adanson's monstera", this plant is petite, more delicate and has a trailing quality that sets it apart from its more commonly known cousin, Monstera Deliciosa.

**Jul 19, 2021: Welcome home Bubbles!** Bubbles comes to me as part of a big haul of ten plants from a friend whittling down his plant family. Swiss Cheese gets its holes from carbon monoxide bubbles, so I thought it was the perfect name for a plant that is also fragile and oh so cute!  Bubbles looks so yellow and not super healthy, so I'm going to find out what I can do to make her happy.
