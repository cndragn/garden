#### Aloe Vera

<u>LIGHT</u>- Very bright indirect light

<u>WATER</u>- Allow soil to completely dry out then water well. Will go dormant in winter and wont require water at all.

<u>FERTILIZER</u>- Once a year in Spring diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.

<u>TEMPERATURE</u>- Warm, between 60-85F

<u>HUMIDITY</u>- Needs very little humidity

<u>MISTING</u>- Not at all.

<u>SOIL</u>- Cactus Potting Mix or mix sand in potting soil.

<u>POT</u>- Shallow root system, move up to a wider, not deeper pot.

<u>PRUNING</u>- Outer leaves if they start getting brown tips. Never prune leaves in the center.

<u>PROPAGATION</u>-  Offsets / pups

<u>BLOOM</u>- Occurs in late Spring, early Summer. Needs to be quite mature.

<u>MATURE SIZE</u>- 1-2 feet tall

---

#### Baby Rubber

<u>LIGHT</u>- Bright, indirect.  East or west facing window is ideal.  Too much sun burns the leaves, too little causes plant to stop growing.

<u>WATER</u>- Allow top 50% to dry out before watering. Bottom watering is best. Overwatering causes root rot.

<u>FERTILIZER</u>- Monthly in spring, summer diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength.

<u>TEMPERATURE</u>-  60-80F. Cold drafts damage leaves

<u>HUMIDITY</u>- Prefer a warm, humid environment

<u>MISTING</u>- Mist lightly, leaves can trap water and cause root rot.

<u>POT</u>- One size up when roots have filled the pot until it reaches the desired size. A too large pot can prevent soil from drying out and cause root rot.

<u>PRUNING</u>- Can be pruned anywhere along the stem. New growth develops from nodes just below the cut in stem.

<u>PROPAGATION</u>-  Leaf cuttings, stem tip cuttings and plant division. Allow cut ends to dry out overmight before planting.

<u>BLOOM</u>- Non-showy white flower spike

<u>MATURE SIZE</u>- Up to 1 foot tall

---

#### Bromeliad

<u>TEMPERATURE</u>-  60-85F

<u>HUMIDITY</u>- Prefers humidity

<u>MISTING</u>- Mist frequently

<u>SOIL</u>- Bromeliad or potting soil

<u>POT</u>- No reason to repot as it will die after blooming.

<u>MISTING</u>- Don't mist directly on top of leaves, or allow water to fall into new leave straws. Spray from the bottom. overall humidity preferred.

<u>POT</u>- In Spring every 2 years if roots have filled the pot

<u>PRUNING</u>- Cut off brown or crispy leaves as soon as they appear

<u>PROPAGATION</u>-  Plant division in Spring at time of repotting

<u>BLOOM</u>- Small and unstriking. Suggested to prune as they apepar, as it takes energy away from the leaves.

<u>MATURE SIZE</u>- 6 feet tall, and 6 feet wide

---

#### Dieffenbachia

<u>HUMIDITY</u>- Does well in high humidity, but adapts to local humidity. 

<u>MISTING</u>- Daily in summer

<u>POT</u>- In Spring if roots have filled existing pot. Likes to be pot bound, so new pot should only be an inch or two wider than old pot.

<u>PRUNING</u>- Aggressively prune to keep it from getting top heavy. Wear gloves to protect from sap and wash tools afterwards.

<u>PROPAGATION</u>-  Air layering and stem cuttings in Spring. With stem cuttings, once new leaves sprout, remove the older leaves.

<u>BLOOM</u>- Spathe and spadix, green and resembles an unfolding leaf.

<u>MATURE SIZE</u>- 3-10 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide

---

#### Jade Plant

<u>LIGHT</u>- Very bright light. Can develop red edges if its bright enough

<u>WATER</u>- Allow to dry out completely before watering. Over watering causes leaves to fall off and stems to get mushy.

---

#### Monstera Adansonii

<u>LIGHT</u>- Bright indirect light or partial shade. Can burn in direct sun

<u>FERTILIZER</u>- Every 2 weeks while plant is actively growing, diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Wait 4-6 mmonths after repotting to fertilize

<u>TEMPERATURE</u>-  Warm, doent do well in temperatures below 50F.

<u>HUMIDITY</u>- Does well in high humidity, but adapts to local humidity. 

<u>MISTING</u>- Once a week in the morning

<u>POT</u>- In Spring, every other year until plant reaches desired size. Bigger pots promote larger leaves. 

<u>PRUNING</u>- Keep leaves clean. Needs to be aggressively trimmed or can take over the space, in Spring or Fall. Cut close to main stem

<u>PROPAGATION</u>-  Stem Cuttings. Be sure to include a few leaves and plant nodes on each cutting and allow to sit out overnight before planting. Can also put cut stems in water and plant in soil once network of roots forms.

<u>BLOOM</u>- Not indoors

<u>MATURE SIZE</u>- 6-8 feet tall, 1-3 feet wide

#### Peace Lily

<u>LIGHT</u>- Medium or indirect bright light. Too much light cause leaves to fade and lose vibrant green colour. Too little light and flowers won't develop. Direct sun burns the leaves.

<u>PROPAGATION</u>-  Plant division when pups appear next to mother plant. Cut pups away from mother plant.

<u>BLOOM</u>- In Spring

<u>MATURE SIZE</u>- up to 3 feet tall indoors

#### Humidity

Increase humidity by grouping plants together, putting a small humidifier or bowl of water near the plant or setting the plant on a tray filled with water and small stones. Be sure pot is sitting on the stones and not in water.

#### Propagation

**Air Layering**

Primarily for large plants with thick stems. Propogated while still attached to parent plant. Can take several months to propogate.

- Use sharp knife to make upward 1" slit just below node on stem of mother plant. The slit should go halfway through the stem. Use toothpick to keep slit open or new roots wont grow
- Remove bark or leaves a few inches above and below the slit. Dust area with rooting hormone that contains fungicide.
- Pack handful of moist sphangnum moss around the slit, secure plastic around it. Check weekly to make sure moss stays moist.
- When roots have filled moss, cut the stem below the new rootball and plant it.

**Leaf Cuttings** 

Remove mature, healthy leaf from actively growing stem. Dip cut end into rooting hormone that containes fungicide. Plant bottom 1/3 of leaf into moist soil. Cover with clear plastic to increase humidity. New plants will grow around the base of the leaf.

**Offsets/Pups**

Offsets are the baby plants that form at the base. Wait until offset is several inches tall, gently detach from mother plant, and plant in small container. Keep barely moist, not soggy.

**Plant Division**

When roots fill the pot, gently pull root ball into sections. Do not cut. Plant sections in pots a few inches larger than the root ball.

Tuber division, for plants that have thick stems or roots called tubers. These plants, such as Caladium, Gixinia, Begonias and Cyclamen should be propagated in the spring when they emerge from dormacy.  Cut tubers into sections, each should have a bud. Dip the cut ends in a rooting hormone that contains a fungicide. Plant tubers just below the soil surface.

**Stem Cuttings**

Use sharp scissors or razor to cut a 4-6" piece from end of a healthy stem, just below a leaf node.  Remove leaves from bottom 1/3rd and dip cut end into rooting hormone. Plant in a 4" pot and cover with clear plastic to increase humidity.  Check every few days to make sure soil is most. Lightly tug every few weeks, if theres resistence roots have developed and plastic can be removed.
