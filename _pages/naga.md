#### Snake Plant | Sansevieria Trifasciata

Ever wonder why you never see artificial snake plants? It's because you don't need artificial versions. The real thing is pretty much unkillable and survives in almost any growing condition.

**Jul 14, 2021: Welcome home Naga!** Naga is part of the Hard To Kill Jungle Set from Horti. I was supposed to get a snake plant in my order from Costa Farms last year, and was disappointed to find it was not included.  All it took was a bit of patience, because now I have my snake plant. He gets his name from the mythical half human, half serpant being Naga in Hindu mythology. Naga is considered strong and handsome, and while dangerous, often beneficial to humans. Like the pothos, this is supposed to be pretty much indestructable, so I have high hopes he will be with me for awhile.

Theres a pup growing which is pretty exciting!  I'll see how it does and at some point research how to separate and repot it.
