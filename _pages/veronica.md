**Jul 19, 2021: Welcome home Veronica!** Veronica comes to me as part of a big haul of ten plants from a friend whittling down his plant family.  Veronica means true image, and I do believe this plant is the true image of beauty, the way her dark green edge frames the silvery green leaves and the burghandy underside.  She is healthy and full, and I hope to keep her that way!
