#### Satin Pothos | Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus

Scindapsus Pictus is commonly sold as a Satin pothos or Silver philodendron, but it's neither a pothos or a philodendron. The heart-shaped leaves have silvery grey splotches, which makes them look almost shiny and adds to the visual appeal of the plant.

**Jul 19, 2021: Welcome home Charmeuse!** Charmeuse comes to me as part of a big haul of ten plants from a friend whittling down his plant family. Charmeuse is already quite big and trailing away which is awesome! I love the heart shaped leaves, and how they have a luxourious velvety texture.
