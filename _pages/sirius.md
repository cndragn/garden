#### Calathea Beauty Star | Goeppertia Ornata

Like other plants in the marantaceae family, this Calathea has the interesting habit of rising leaves in the morning and lowering them at night, like in prayer, giving it the nickname "prayer plant." This is the very same plant as the Pinstripe, Beauty Star is simply another name it's known by.

**Jul 19, 2021: Welcome home Sirius!** Sirius comes to me as part of a big haul of ten plants from a friend whittling down his plant family.  I love his leaves, the colouring makes me think of the brush strokes in a painting.
