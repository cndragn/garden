#### Peace Lily | Spathiphyllum

##### Description and Care

The peace lily is an easy to care for plant that likes medium to low light. More light produces the lily-like leaves, while in low light the plant will look like a regular foilage plant. Drought tolerant, so don't overwater. Can wait until topsoil is dry, or even til the plant begins to wilt to water again. Mist daily.

**Aug 7 Welcome home Misty!** I ordered some more plants from Costa Farms through Amazon, and since they send random varieities, it was a surprise which ones I'd get. I'm really excited to get this one, lilies are my favorite and I think this one is so pretty! This one arrived with a leaf that was dark brown, which is kind of a bummer, but I hope that isn't a bad sign for Misty's future. I put it in the living room, but that I realize it does better and creates the lily-like leaves with more sunshine, I'm going to move it into my office.
