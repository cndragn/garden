#### Peace Lily | Spathiphyllum

##### Description and Care

The peace lily is an easy to care for plant that likes medium to low light. More light produces the lily-like leaves, while in low light the plant will look like a regular foilage plant. Drought tolerant, so don't overwater. Can wait until topsoil is dry, or even til the plant begins to wilt to water again. Mist daily.

**Aug 7 Correction, the spathes turn green in sunshine** So, what looks like a white flower is actually a special leaf, called a spathe, that grows over the actual flower which is the spikey thing at the end of the stem. Well..I noticed all of them were turning green. Turns out, more sunshine amplifies photosynthesis and makes the leaves green, whereas less sunshine makes them white. So, its still healthy! Just, not the pretty classic look of Peace Lily that I'd like. I've moved it back out of my office and into the dining room where its bright, but no direct sunshine. I also learned that the leaf that started turning brown is just a natural occurance that happens at the end of it's life cycle, which lasts about a month. So I just need to trim that one away and everything is good to go.

**Aug 7 Welcome home Misty!** I ordered some more plants from Costa Farms through Amazon, and since they send random varieities, it was a surprise which ones I'd get. I'm really excited to get this one, lilies are my favorite and I think this one is so pretty! This one arrived with a leaf that was dark brown, which is kind of a bummer, but I hope that isn't a bad sign for Misty's future. I put it in the living room, but that I know it creates the pretty lily leaves with more sunshine, I'm going to move it into my office.
