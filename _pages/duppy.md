#### Ghost Plant / Mother of Pearl | Graptopetalum Paraguayense

This Graptopetalum has beautiful trailing rosettes, perfect for a hanging pot.

These plants have color changing abilities. Full sun is the best location for them, but growing succulent ghost plants in partial shade produces the bluish-gray tones. Full sun plants tend to be yellowish-pink, pearlescent and slightly translucent. Those in punishing heat turn gray with pink overtones.

Graptopetalum should be watered using the “soak and dry” method. Be sure that the soil is completely dry after watering to avoid root rot and pests.

##### Updates

**Jul 21, 2021: Oh Dear** I'm too embarrassed to even post an update photo.  The dark winter hit Duppy hard.  He suffered my bright idea of putting my plants outside for some sunshine, which turned into a freezing cold rainy weekend.  He got leggy trying to reach for the sun all winter then after the weekend outside, all his leaves fell off.  It's been several months and he looks dead, but also alive?  I just got plant lights, so he's under them now, and I trimmed the stem. I have no idea if he's dead or not...his name is way too accurate.

**Aug 15, 2020: Say hello to Duppy!** I snagged this one from Ayanna after it had been neglected for almost a year. Super surprised to see it still hanging on to life! Hopefully, with some love and care it will start to grow and flourish.
