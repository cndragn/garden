#### Ghost Plant / Mother of Pearl | Graptopetalum Paraguayense

##### Description and Care

This Graptopetalum has beautiful trailing rosettes, perfect for a hanging pot.

These plants have color changing abilities. Full sun is the best location for them, but growing succulent ghost plants in partial shade produces the bluish-gray tones. Full sun plants tend to be yellowish-pink, pearlescent and slightly translucent. Those in punishing heat turn gray with pink overtones.

Graptopetalum should be watered using the “soak and dry” method. Be sure that the soil is completely dry after watering to avoid root rot and pests.

**Aug 15: Say hello to Duppy!** I snagged this one from Ayanna after it had been neglected for almost a year. Super surprised to see it still hanging on to life! Hopefully, with some love and care it will start to grow and flourish.
