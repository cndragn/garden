**Jul 19, 2021: Welcome home Vittus!** Vittus comes to me as part of a big haul of ten plants from a friend whittling down his plant family.  His name comes from Vitu, which means "forest as a borerline". Vittus' leaves are looking pretty rough, but he has new leaves coming in, so I'm excited to see how he comes along.
