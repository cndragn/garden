**Jul 14, 2021: Welcome home Malachi!** Malachi is part of the Hard To Kill Jungle Set from Horti. Malachi gets his name, uncreatively enough, from malachite. I know malachite and jade are two different things! But they're both green and pretty so...here we are. My sister told me she calls these Shrek ears, which I think is totally adorabe and now I can't unsee it!
