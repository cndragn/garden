**Aug 20, 2021: Is this the same plant?!** I swear it is!! I didn't even realize how much Luci grew over the past year til I saw the pics of when I first got him.  I barely paid any attention to him, and not only did he not die, he grew and grew!  He's been in my bathroom pretty much all this time and seems to be pretty happy there.  *Warm fuzzies!*

**Aug 20, 2020: A leaf died** Luci has a yellow leaf and I don't know why! It's not from overwatering, I have only watered it once since I got it, and I've been monitoring it with my moisture level tool. A friend suggested I put it in a place with more sunshine, so I'm moving it into my office for a few days to see how it does.

**Aug 7, 2020: Welcome home Luci!** Luci came in the variety set from Costa Farms when I ordered from Amazon. It arrived in great shape, really nice looking and already looking like its doing the viny ivy thing. I decided to put it on the mantle in the livingroom because I think it will look really pretty as it grows downwards. Really looking forward to seeing this one grow and fill out.
