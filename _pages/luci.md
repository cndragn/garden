#### Devil's Ivy | Pothos

##### Description and Care

Pothos is super easy going and can do well in bright or low light, and fine with dry soil or even vases of water. Can survive and grow in just about any environment and can get out of control, giving it the name the Devil's Ivy.

##### Updates

**Aug 7: Welcome home Luci!** Luci came in the variety set from Costa Farms when I ordered from Amazon. It arrived in great shape, really nice looking and already looking like its doing the viny ivy thing. I decided to put it on the mantle in the livingroom because I think it will look really pretty as it grows downwards. Really looking forward to seeing this one grow and fill out.
