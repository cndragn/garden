#### Thyme

**Description and Care**

Germination: 21-28 days<br/>
Harvest: 50-70 days<br/>
Planted: Aug 7<br/>
Check on: Aug 28

Does well when planted along with Oregano. Both of these herbs do better when not constantly watered. Water deeply only when soil is completely dry.

**Aug 7: Planted thyme seeds** I used one of the travel pots from my other plants since they had drainage, then put it into a cute tin planter that Ski got awhile ago. I found a tip to cover with saran wrap until the seeds germinate, hopefully that will work!

#### Parsley

**Description and Care**

Germination: 10-25 days<br/>
Harvest: 30-60 days<br/>
Planted: Aug 8<br/>
Check on: Aug 18

Harvest when leaf stems have three segments. Cut leaves from the outer portions of the plant whenever you need them. Leave the inner portions of the plant to mature.

**Aug 7: Soaking parsley seeds** Read advice to soak these seeds overnight before planting. After that, I'll plant them in one of the self watering pots and cover with saran wrap.

#### Cilantro

**Description and Care**

Germination: 7-14 days<br/>
Harvest: 50-70 days<br/>
Planted: Aug 9<br/>
Check on: Aug 16<br/>

Before planting seeds, gently crush them, let them soak for 24-48 hours, then let them dry.

**Aug 7: Soaking cilantro seeds** These will need a couple days of soaking before I can plant them. I'll put these in one of the self watering pots and cover with saran wrap.

Germination: 10-15 days<br/>
Harvest: 45-60 days<br/>

**Aug 7: Planted mint seeds** I put this one in a self watering pot. There wasn't a whole lot of info about mint except that it grows pretty wild and crazy outdoors. It seems to be a pretty easy herb to grow and take care of...will see! This one was a bit of a priority for us...it will be great to make tea and drinks with.

#### Oregano

**Description and Care**

Germination: 7-14 days<br/>
Harvest: 35-44 days<br/>

**Aug 7: Planted oregano seeds** Like with thyme, these dont need a whole lot of water and prefer to be dried out, so I didnt put these in a self watering pot. I think that eventually, I'll get window planters with drainage and repot this with thyme.
