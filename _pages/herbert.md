#### Updates

**Jul 20, 2021: Everything died, starting over...again!**

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/herbert-jul20-21.jpg">

Things were going pretty well until winter hit, and then all my herbs died.  Now I know, the garden window is just way too cold in the winter, so I'll have to move them inside once the temperatures start to drop.  Another possibility is they just weren't getting enough light.  On a good day the garden window doesn't get any sun just some daylight, and in the winter it's super dark. My sister got me some plant lights, and already I can tell the huge difference its making.

I planted all the seeds a couple weeks ago, on Jul 9th, and they all came to life within a week...except the mint.  I messed up! I covered the seeds with soil, but they need light to germinate.  I'm all out of mint seeds so going to order some more.  Mint is the one I want to grow most of all! I'd love to be able to kick back with a cup of mint tea while admiring my kitchen garden.

**Sept 01, 2020: Chives died, starting over**

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/chives-sept01.jpg">

Wish I'd taken a pic of how my chives were doing a week or so ago. They sprouted, started growing, then just...stopped. And then, they all died :( So, did some research and realized its one of those herbs that can't handle constant water, so being in the self watering pot killed it.

I've started over today, its still in the same pot, I just emptied the water reserve, planted seeds and put it in the closet to germinate. Hopefully, better luck this time.

**Aug 31, 2020: Moved Chives, Mint, Oregano & Thyme Outside**

Chives, Mint, Oregano and Thyme were struggling to grow while all the other Herberts are thriving, so I feel like they are not getting enough sun in the kitchen window. I've moved them outside, so hopefully I'll start seeing a difference soon. I also planted more seeds for Mint because there is still just that one solitary teeny little sprout.

<hr/>

**Aug 20, 2020: Planted cilantro seeds II**

After waiting almost two weeks with no sign of cilantro, I did some research and replanted with a few changes. I did not crush the seeds before soaking them overnight, did not cover the seeds with soil, and this time I put it in a dark place to germinate.

<hr/>

**Aug 17, 2020: Peeking Parsley / Mint Needs light to germinate**

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/parsley-aug17.jpg">

It's like playing Where's Waldo to see the teeny bit of Parsley, but it's there! I've decided to leave the saran wrap on for another day and hopefully more will come through soon.

Today I learned mint seeds should not be covered with soil. That was not in the guide I used for planting seeds. So..today I sprinkled more seeds on top of the soil. So the new check date is Aug 27.

<hr/>

**Aug 17, 2020: Dill and Chives sprouted**

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/dill-aug17.jpg">

Dill wasted no time and coming in strong way ahead of the germination schedule!

<hr/>

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/chives-aug17.jpg">

Way ahead of schedule Chives burst onto the scene! There was nothing to see when I did my morning rounds, but in the afternoon Chives decided it was done sitting in a dark closet and shot out the soil. I've moved them into the kitchen window to join the rest of the Herberts.

<hr/>

**Aug 16, 2020: Basil sprouted**

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/basil-aug16.jpg">

Right on time according to the germination schedule, Basil made its appearance today!

<hr/>

**Aug 12, 2020: Oregano sprouted**

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/oregano-aug12.jpg">

Teeny tiny sprouts, but they are off to a great start!

<hr/>

**Aug 10, 2020: Thyme spouted**

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/thyme-aug10.jpg">

Wasn't expecting this to happen for 3 weeks, but I already see sprouts!

<hr/>

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/cilantro-aug7.jpg">

**Aug 8, 2020: Planted cilantro seeds**

<hr/>

**Aug 7, 2020: Planted thyme seeds / Soaking parsley and cilantro seeds**

I used one of the travel pots from my other plants to plant Thyme since they had drainage, then put it into a cute tin planter that Ski got awhile ago. I found a tip to cover with saran wrap until the seeds germinate, hopefully that will work!

<hr/>

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/parsley-aug7.jpg">

Read advice to soak Parsley seeds overnight before planting. After that, I'll plant them in one of the self watering pots and cover with saran wrap.

<hr/>

Cilantro will need a couple days of soaking before I can plant them. I'll put these in one of the self watering pots and cover with saran wrap.

<hr/>

**Aug 7, 2020: Planted mint and oregano seeds**

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/mint-aug7.jpg">

I put Mint in a self watering pot. There wasn't a whole lot of info about mint except that it grows pretty wild and crazy outdoors. It seems to be a pretty easy herb to grow and take care of...will see! This one was a bit of a priority for us...it will be great to make tea and drinks with.

<hr/>

<img class="figure-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/herberts/thyme-oregano-aug7.jpg">

Like with thyme, Oregano doesn't need a whole lot of water and prefer to be dried out, so I didnt put these in a self watering pot. I think that eventually, I'll get window planters with drainage and repot this with thyme.

<hr/>

#### Thyme

Germination: 21-28 days<br/>
Harvest: 50-70 days<br/>
Planted: Jul 9<br/>

Does well when planted along with Oregano. Both of these herbs do better when not constantly watered. Water deeply only when soil is completely dry.

#### Parsley

Germination: 10-25 days<br/>
Harvest: 30-60 days<br/>
Planted: Jul 9<br/>

Harvest when leaf stems have three segments. Cut leaves from the outer portions of the plant whenever you need them. Leave the inner portions of the plant to mature.

#### Cilantro

Germination: 7-14 days<br/>
Harvest: 50-70 days<br/>
Planted: Jul 9<br/>

Before planting seeds, gently crush them, let them soak for 24-48 hours, then let them dry.

#### Mint

Germination: 10-15 days<br/>
Harvest: 45-60 days<br/>
Planted: Jul 9<br/>

Needs light to germinate, do not cover with soil.

#### Oregano

Germination: 7-14 days<br/>
Harvest: 35-44 days<br/>
Planted: Aug 7<br/>

#### Basil

Germination: 5-10 days<br/>
Harvest: 30-60 days<br/>
Planted: Jul 9<br/>

Harvest:
After the seedlings have produced their first six leaves, prune to above the second set. This encourages the plants to start branching, resulting in more leaves for harvest.

Every time a branch has six to eight leaves, repeat pruning the branches back to their first set of leaves.

After about 6 weeks, pinch off the center shoot to prevent early flowering. If flowers do grow, just cut them off.

#### Dill

Germination: 10-14 days<br/>
Harvest: 25-40 days<br/>
Planted: Jul 9<br/>

Dill grows a long tap root, and needs a container at least 12 inches deep.

When temperatures rise, dill tends to "bolt" and send up flower stalks so it can set seeds. Cut the flower stalks after the yellow blooms have faded, place a small paper bag with a few tiny holes for ventilation, and wait for the seeds to fall and gather in the bottom of the bag.

#### Chives

Germination: 10-14 days<br/>
Harvest: 30-40 days<br/>
Planted: Jul 9<br/>

Place the pot in a dark spot in temperatures 60 to 70 F. (15 to 21 C.) until the seeds sprout, then move them into the light.

Once the chives are about a foot tall, simply snip off what you need.

#### Marjoram

Germination: 14-21 days<br/>
Harvest: 60 days<br/>
Planted: Jul 9<br/>

After seeding, keep soil moist and give around 16hrs of light a day.

#### Tarragon

Germination: 7-14 days<br/>
Harvest: 90 days<br/>
Planted: Jul 9<br/>

Leaves can be harvested as soon as the shoots are about six inches tall. Cut the stem back to four to six inches, just below a leaf node.
