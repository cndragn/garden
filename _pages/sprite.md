#### Lemon Lime Prayer Plant | Maranta Leuconeura

The maranta is a close relative to the calathea with its boldly patterned foliage, and tendency to fold its leaves every night. This lemon lime variety has a uniquely striped pattern on its leaves, with a mix of green, chartreuse, and yellow colors. It is nicknamed the prayer plant because of that habit of folding its leaves, and has a tendency toward trailing.

**Jul 19, 2021: Welcome home Sprite!** Sprite comes to me as part of a big haul of ten plants from a friend whittling down his plant family. I'm mesmorized by the colouring of their leaves, so incredibly striking! The growth seems a little rough and lopsided, but the leaves are gorgeous, so I'm excited to see how it fills out and grows.
